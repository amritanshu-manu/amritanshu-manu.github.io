Project Description
---
The objective was to design longitudinal and lateral control for a 18 wheel truck through design of experiments and using system identification methods. A second-order transfer function model was obtained at various speed ranges through input-output modeling which was validated through additional experiments. A PID throttle control and Stanley control for steering was implemented and later tested in real-time, for fine-tuning the control gains.
