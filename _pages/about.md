Hello World!

I'm a Motion Control Software Engineer working with Automated Driving Motion Controls Team in Jaguar Land Rover, contributing towards the exciting future of vehicle autonomy while ensuring brand's DNA by delivering motion services for a safe and comfortable journey.

I received my Bachelors and Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Robotics and Control, from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research interests are in the field of Robotics, Dynamics, Vibration and Control. I like working on mathematical modeling and simulation, which intrigues me to visualize every new problem through governing equations and enjoy the mathematics behind it.

<!-- The best part of the research is when you just smile at a challenging problem realizing the scope of the problem and the learning through the process. -->

<!-- I'm currently working on "Gait Planning and Optimization for a Biped, using concepts of Geometric Control". -->

<!-- Being an automotive enthusiast, my college life was mainly spent in building various full-scale vehicles, be it a 4WD-AWS Electric vehicle, a Formula Student vehicle or an All-terrain vehicle.   -->

I have worked on Gait Planning and Optimization for my master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Mangal Kothari](https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/). Along with my thesis, I worked as a Senior Student Research Associate for the development of a 4WD-AWS Electric Vehicle under [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Ramprasad Potluri](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~potluri/). For more details about my work, see [Projects](https://praditya.github.io/projects/).<!-- I worked on mathematical modeling of the full car model for suspension design and design of a spaceframe chassis for two passengers. The vehicle is unique in the sense that it involves independent suspension modules for all four wheels which are integrated into a spaceframe chassis, and each module is controlled for steering and drive for maneuvering according to a global objective. -->

I am a motorsport enthusiast, and proudly claims to contribute towards development of five in-house vehicles during my college tenure. Apart from academics, I'm a photography enthusiast and love playing badminton and table-tennis, actively participating in every sport.
<!-- I have worked as a Visiting Scholar in [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://unmanned.tamu.edu/) under [Dr. Srikanth Saripalli](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/saripalli.html), on System Identification and Control Design of 18-Wheeled Truck. Also, I've been an active member of [IITK Motorsports](https://iitkms.in/), SAE collegiate team of the campus, throughout my stay. I joined the team in my freshman year and has contributed to building a Formula student vehicle and an All-Terrain vehicle, representing the college in Formula Bharat'18 and Mega ATV Championship'19. For more details about my work, see [Projects](https://praditya.github.io/projects/). -->

<!-- I joined Formula Student team in my freshman year, where I started working in Chassis subsytem. I worked on designing and analysis of a spaceframe chassis for Formula prototype vehicle. In my sophomore year, I worked on manufacturing of the complete vehicle along with lab and field testing of various components, including experimental torsional testing of frame and quasi-static impact testing of non-standard Impact attenuator.   -->

<!-- I've recently developed an interest in Psychology and a habit of reading novels.   -->
