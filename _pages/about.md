I am a doctoral student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, specializing in Robotics and Automation. I am associated with the [Mobile Robotics Laboratory](mrl-iitk.github.io)(MRL). My research focusses on the control of legged locomotion and development quadruped robots for practical applications, under the guidance of [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Mangal Kothari](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mangal/). I have also been selected for the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship.

I finished my bachelor's and master's from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur. I worked on optimization-based dynamic gait generation for quadruped robots, advised by Prof. Gupta and Prof. Kothari. During my master's I developed the fascination for making these complicated machines move efficiently. For more details about my work, see [Projects](https://amritanshu-manu.github.io/projects/). My professional experience includes an year-long stint as a business data analyst at LG Ad Solutions, before returning to MRL.
