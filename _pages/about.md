Hello World!


I have worked on Gait Planning and Optimization for my master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Mangal Kothari](https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/). Along with my thesis, I worked as a Senior Student Research Associate for the development of a 4WD-AWS Electric Vehicle under [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Ramprasad Potluri](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~potluri/). For more details about my work, see [Projects](https://praditya.github.io/projects/).
