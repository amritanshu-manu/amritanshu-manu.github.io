I am a doctoral student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, specializing in Robotics and Automation. I am associated with the [Mobile Robotics Laboratory](mrl-iitk.github.io) (MRL). My research focuses on the control of legged locomotion and the development of quadruped robots for practical applications under the guidance of [Prof. Shakti S. Gupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ssgupta/) and [Prof. Mangal Kothari](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mangal/). I have also been selected for the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship.

I finished my bachelor's and master's from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur. I worked on optimization-based dynamic gait generation for quadruped robots, advised by Prof. Gupta and Prof. Kothari. During my master's, I developed a fascination for making these complicated machines move efficiently. For more details about my work, see [Projects](https://amritanshu-manu.github.io/projects/). My professional experience includes a year-long stint as a business data analyst at [LG Ad Solutions](https://lgads.tv/) before returning to MRL.

Apart from academics, I love being involved in physical activities. I started playing volleyball as a freshman during my bachelor's and have been a part of the institute volleyball team since then. Going on trekking expeditions is my escape from reality.
