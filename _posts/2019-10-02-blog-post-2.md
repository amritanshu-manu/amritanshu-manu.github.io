The question is whether you are living your own life or someone else's.

Approximately Myself, copyrights for my to-be autobiography :).

Why follow?

The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat. - Lily Tomlin

If you are standing in the majority, you need to examine yourselves.

Are we seeking a moment out of our present life just to breathe? Into a parallel world where nothing really matters, where no one is observing us or no one cares. A moment where we are just being idle, pausing our actions and free from any external thoughts wanting some time in oblivion.
We are running a race, spending all our time to plan our future without letting ourselves to live in the present moment.

That’s where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory. Seeking oblivion

A way of writing: The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

How will life change if you realize this is the last day of your life?

“A small fact:
You are going to die....does this worry you?”
― Markus Zusak, The Book Thief

Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die.
